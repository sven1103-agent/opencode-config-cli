## Decision Log

### <a id="dec-001"></a>DEC-001 - CLI is the sole official distribution channel for V1

The helper CLI is the only supported distribution mechanism for official OpenCode setup assets in V1.

Included in the CLI release bundle:
- Official config presets
- Official inter-agent schema contracts
- Version metadata needed for validation and provenance

Implications:
- Users do not need to clone this repository to use the official setup assets
- The CLI release is the canonical end-user artifact
- `self-update` updates the CLI and bundled assets together
- Live remote schema fetching is out of scope for V1

### <a id="dec-002"></a>DEC-002 - Config bundles are distributed via versioned config sources (V2+)

Starting in V2+, official OpenCode configuration assets (presets + prompts) are distributed via one or more separate versioned config sources with independent release flow.

Supported source types may include:
- local directories
- local `.tar.gz` archive files
- versioned remote release assets (for example GitHub release bundles)

The helper CLI remains the supported installer/applier:
- The CLI can register one or more config sources.
- The CLI resolves and caches config bundles from supported source types.
- The CLI applies a chosen bundle (and preset within it) into a target project.
- The CLI reports provenance for installed bundles/presets/prompts.

Interaction with DEC-001:
- DEC-001 remains the V1 baseline.
- DEC-002 supersedes DEC-001 for V2+ scope.

---

## PRD

### <a id="prd-001"></a>PRD-001 - Product Goal

Provide a small helper CLI that bootstraps and maintains a local OpenCode project setup using official bundled config presets and official bundled inter-agent schemas, with safe validation and self-update behavior tied to CLI releases.

V2+ direction (see [DEC-002](#dec-002)):
- The CLI bootstraps and maintains a local OpenCode project setup by installing and applying config bundles from registered config sources.
- The CLI may still ship with minimal built-in defaults, but official presets/prompts are expected to come from external config sources.

### <a id="prd-002"></a>PRD-002 - Problem Statement

Current OpenCode project setup depends on repository-local assets and setup knowledge that are not yet exposed through a single user-facing distribution and setup workflow. Users may not want to clone the repository locally just to obtain supported presets and schema files.

### <a id="prd-003"></a>PRD-003 - Target Users

- Maintainers who publish and evolve the official OpenCode setup
- Developers who want to initialize a project with a supported OpenCode setup
- Contributors who need a repeatable, validated local setup flow

### <a id="prd-004"></a>PRD-004 - User Value

The helper CLI should let a user:
- run a low-friction installer wizard (`opencode-helper-install`) to install `opencode-helper` globally and ensure it is available on `PATH`
- inspect all available presets with a short description of each preset's purpose
- apply a supported local configuration
- install required schemas
- validate setup health
- update to the latest supported release

V2+ user value additions:
- register one or more config sources
- browse presets across sources (with source + bundle release context)
- install and apply a chosen config bundle release (including referenced prompt files)
- see provenance of installed bundle/preset/prompts
- check for newer compatible bundle releases from update-capable sources and get prompted before updating

### <a id="prd-005"></a>PRD-005 - Success Criteria

V1 is successful when:
- A user can install `opencode-helper` without cloning this repository (via the `opencode-helper-install` wizard)
- A user can complete a global install such that `opencode-helper` works in a new terminal session (with `PATH` updated by the installer)
- A user can initialize a project from bundled presets and schemas
- A user can list all bundled presets and understand each preset's purpose before selecting one
- A user can validate whether the project setup is healthy or drifted
- A user can update the CLI and bundled assets via GitHub release upgrade
- Installed project assets can be traced back to the CLI release version

---

## Scope

### In Scope

- Bundling official config presets with the CLI release
- Bundling all available official OpenCode config variants with the CLI release
- Bundling official inter-agent schemas with the CLI release
- Project-local setup from bundled assets
- Preset discovery with short human-readable descriptions or purpose text
- Safe install/apply behavior for project files
- Validation and diagnostics
- Self-update from the latest GitHub release
- Version/provenance reporting for bundled assets

### In Scope (V2+ config bundles)

- Registering and managing one or more config sources
- Resolving/caching config bundles from supported source types
- Preset discovery across registered sources (including descriptions and provenance context)
- Applying a selected bundle release (and preset) to a project
- Installing prompt files referenced by presets (e.g. `{file:./prompts/...}`) as part of applying a bundle
- Reporting provenance for installed bundle/preset/prompt files
- Checking for newer compatible bundle releases from update-capable sources and prompting the user before updating installed bundles

### Out of Scope

- Direct end-user fetching of raw assets from GitHub releases
- Live remote schema syncing during normal setup
- Automatic migration of arbitrary user-customized configs
- Windows support unless explicitly added later
- Full remote orchestration or hosted service behavior

V2+ out of scope (initially):
- Automatically merging arbitrary user overlays with bundle upgrades
- Mandatory online operation after bundles are installed/cached
- Config repo authentication flows beyond what the underlying git/http tooling supports by default

Supported source types for the first V2+ scope baseline:
- local directory source
- local `.tar.gz` archive source
- GitHub release bundle source

- [REQ-F-004](#req-f-004)

#### <a id="req-f-012"></a>REQ-F-012 - Install Flow Behavior Matrix

The installer wizard (`opencode-helper-install`) shall install `opencode-helper` globally on macOS and Linux with zero prompts in non-interactive contexts (including piped `curl|sh` and `wget|sh`).

Prompt behavior:
- non-interactive mode (`--yes` or non-TTY stdin): no prompts
- interactive TTY mode: prompt only for install location when default `~/.local/bin` is inconvenient and `--bin-dir` is not provided

The installer shall detect the active user shell and update `PATH` by editing the correct shell config file when shell detection succeeds.

Shell config targets and selection rules:
- zsh: write `PATH` updates to `~/.zshrc`
- bash (macOS): write to the first match in order: `~/.bash_profile` (if exists), else `~/.bashrc` (if exists), else create and write `~/.bash_profile`
- bash (Linux): write to the first match in order: `~/.bashrc` (if exists), else `~/.bash_profile` (if exists), else create and write `~/.bashrc`
- fish: write to `~/.config/fish/config.fish` (create parent dir and file if missing)

Depends on:
- [REQ-NF-005](#req-nf-005)

#### <a id="req-f-013"></a>REQ-F-013 - Non-Interactive Install Flags

The installer wizard (`opencode-helper-install`) shall support non-interactive install flags suitable for CI/power users, including at least:
- `--yes`
- `--bin-dir <path>`

In non-interactive mode (`--yes` or non-TTY stdin), the CLI shall not prompt. Shell config choice shall be derived from `$SHELL` using the selection rules in [REQ-F-012](#req-f-012). If `$SHELL` is unset or unsupported, installation shall continue but PATH file edits shall be skipped with a warning and manual PATH guidance.

Optionally:
- `--dry-run` (if implemented): print planned actions (install path, sudo/no-sudo decision, shell config file path, and the exact `PATH` line/block to be added/updated) and make no changes; must not request `sudo`.

Depends on:
- [REQ-F-012](#req-f-012)

#### <a id="req-f-014"></a>REQ-F-014 - Idempotent Shell Config Edits and Privilege Boundaries

The installer wizard (`opencode-helper-install`) shall make idempotent shell config edits using stable markers and shall avoid duplicate `PATH` entries.

Shell config edits shall be managed via a single marker block with these exact sentinel lines:
- `# opencode-helper: BEGIN managed PATH`
- `# opencode-helper: END managed PATH`

On re-run, if the marker block exists, the CLI shall update the contents within the block in place (and shall not add a second block). The resulting config must include exactly one occurrence of the chosen `--bin-dir` in the `PATH` update it writes.

The CLI shall use `sudo` only when the chosen install directory is privileged. For this requirement, a privileged install directory is any `--bin-dir` that:
- is under one of: `/usr/local`, `/opt/homebrew`, `/usr/bin`, `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/opt`, or
- is not writable by the invoking user

When `sudo` is required, it shall apply only to writing the installed binary into the privileged `--bin-dir`; shell config edits shall be performed as the invoking user.

Depends on:
- [REQ-F-012](#req-f-012)

#### <a id="req-f-015"></a>REQ-F-015 - Release Bundle Installation Source

The installer wizard (`opencode-helper-install`) shall install official helper releases by fetching versioned release assets from GitHub Releases rather than copying repo-local files.

The default install target shall be the latest supported GitHub release.

The installed release bundle shall contain:
- the `opencode-helper` executable entrypoint
- all officially supported bundled config presets for that release
- the official bundled inter-agent schemas for that release
- release metadata sufficient to report installed release provenance

Depends on:
- [DEC-001](#dec-001)
- [REQ-F-001](#req-f-001)
- [REQ-F-002](#req-f-002)

#### <a id="req-f-016"></a>REQ-F-016 - Release Bundle Checksum Verification

Before installing a downloaded release bundle, the installer wizard (`opencode-helper-install`) shall verify the bundle checksum against a checksum manifest published with the same GitHub release.

Verification requirements:
- the checksum algorithm shall be SHA-256
- the installer shall fail closed if the checksum manifest is missing, unreadable, lacks a matching bundle entry, or the computed checksum does not match the published checksum
- no bundle contents shall be activated for use if checksum verification fails

Depends on:
- [REQ-F-015](#req-f-015)

#### <a id="req-f-017"></a>REQ-F-017 - Release Selection

The installer wizard (`opencode-helper-install`) shall install the latest supported release by default and shall also support explicit installation of a user-selected older release tag.

At minimum, the installer shall support:
- default latest-release installation behavior
- a release selection flag `--version <tag>`

Depends on:
- [REQ-F-015](#req-f-015)

#### <a id="req-f-018"></a>REQ-F-018 - Installed Release Visibility and Update Awareness

The installer wizard (`opencode-helper-install`) and the helper CLI shall make the installed release visible to the user.

At minimum:
- the installer shall print the target release before installation and the active installed release after installation
- the helper CLI shall report the installed release tag together with bundled asset provenance metadata
- the helper CLI should indicate whether the active release is the latest supported release when network access is available for that check

Depends on:
- [REQ-F-015](#req-f-015)
- [REQ-F-009](#req-f-009)

#### <a id="req-f-019"></a>REQ-F-019 - Side-by-Side Versioned Installs and Rollback

The installer wizard (`opencode-helper-install`) shall install each helper release into a versioned side-by-side location and activate one release via a stable `current` symlink or equivalent indirection.

Rollback requirements:
- installing a newer release shall not require deleting previously installed releases by default
- activation of the selected release shall update the stable launcher/symlink to the chosen versioned install root
- users shall be able to revert to an already installed older release without re-downloading assets if that older release remains present locally
- helper CLI shall expose `opencode-helper release use <tag>` to reactivate an already installed local release without network access

Depends on:
- [REQ-F-015](#req-f-015)
- [REQ-F-017](#req-f-017)

#### <a id="req-f-020"></a>REQ-F-020 - Bootstrap Install Script

The helper CLI shall publish a standalone bootstrap install script (`install.sh`) as a separate release asset alongside the release bundle, enabling the standard `curl|sh` one-liner distribution:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/sven1103-agent/opencode-agents/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
```

The bootstrap script shall:

- Be self-contained and small (under 100 lines of shell)
- Use only `curl` or `wget` (whichever is available) to download assets
- Accept the same flags as `opencode-helper-install` (`--bin-dir`, `--version`)
- Accept `OPENCODE_HELPER_VERSION` as an environment variable to pin the release tag
- Fetch `opencode-helper-<tag>-checksums.txt` from the same release and verify the downloaded `opencode-helper-install` before executing it
- Pass through all arguments to `opencode-helper-install --yes`

The bootstrap script is itself a release asset. It is:
- Included in the release tarball bundle at the bundle root
- Also uploaded as a separate release asset file so it can be downloaded independently from the GitHub Releases page

The bootstrap script shall NOT download the tarball. Its single responsibility is to download, verify, and delegate to `opencode-helper-install`.

Depends on:
- [DEC-001](#dec-001)
- [REQ-F-015](#req-f-015)
- [REQ-F-016](#req-f-016)

#### <a id="req-f-021"></a>REQ-F-021 - Config Source Registry

The CLI shall support registering one or more config sources in a global (user-level) registry so that config bundles can be discovered and installed.

Registry items must include at least:
- a source location
- a source type, or enough information for the CLI to determine the source type during validation
- a stable local identifier derived from the source manifest or assigned by the CLI

Depends on:
- [DEC-002](#dec-002)

#### <a id="req-f-022"></a>REQ-F-022 - Config Bundle Manifest Contract

Each config bundle shall include a machine-readable manifest file at a fixed path:
- `opencode-bundle.manifest.json`

The manifest shall use JSON and a versioned top-level structure that the CLI can validate.

Required top-level fields:
- `manifest_version` - manifest format version understood by the CLI
- `bundle_name` - stable bundle identifier
- `bundle_version` - bundle release/tag or other source-level version identifier
- `presets` - array of preset descriptors

Each preset descriptor shall include:
- `name` - stable preset identifier
- `description` - short human-readable description
- `entrypoint` - path to the preset config file within the bundle
- `prompt_files` - array of prompt file paths that must be materialized when the preset is applied

Optional provenance fields:
- `source_repo`
- `source_commit`
- `release_tag`

The CLI shall reject a bundle when:
- the manifest file is missing
- the manifest is not valid JSON
- `manifest_version` is unsupported
- any required field is missing
- a declared `entrypoint` or `prompt_files` path does not exist in the bundle

Note: a published JSON Schema for this manifest may be added later, but the file location, field names, and validation rules above are normative for V2+ behavior.

Example manifest:

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 1,
  "bundle_name": "official-openai",
  "bundle_version": "v2.0.0",
  "source_repo": "https://github.com/example/opencode-configs",
  "source_commit": "abc1234",
  "release_tag": "v2.0.0",
  "presets": [
    {
      "name": "openai",
      "description": "OpenAI-based planning-first preset",
      "entrypoint": "presets/opencode.openai.json",
      "prompt_files": [
        "prompts/coding-boss.txt",
        "prompts/planner.txt",
        "prompts/code-reviewer.txt"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Depends on:
- [DEC-002](#dec-002)

---

### <a id="bundle-manifest-reference"></a>Bundle Manifest Reference

The `opencode-bundle.manifest.json` file is the core contract between the config bundle and the V2 CLI. It must be present at the root of every V2-compatible bundle.

#### File Location

```
<bundle-root>/
  opencode-bundle.manifest.json  <- required at bundle root
  opencode.openai.json           <- preset files referenced by manifest
  opencode.mixed.json
  ...
```

#### Required Structure

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 1,
  "bundle_name": "opencode-helper",
  "bundle_version": "v1.0.0",
  "presets": [
    {
      "name": "openai",
      "description": "OpenAI GPT-5 based coding and docs agents",
      "entrypoint": "opencode.openai.json",
      "prompt_files": []
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Field Reference

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `manifest_version` | integer | Yes | Currently must be `1`. CLI rejects unsupported versions. |
| `bundle_name` | string | Yes | Stable identifier for the bundle (e.g., "opencode-helper") |
| `bundle_version` | string | Yes | Release tag or version string (e.g., "v1.0.0") |
| `presets` | array | Yes | Array of preset descriptor objects |

#### Preset Descriptor

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Yes | Stable identifier (lowercase, hyphens allowed) |
| `description` | string | Yes | Short human-readable description |
| `entrypoint` | string | Yes | Path to preset JSON file relative to bundle root |
| `prompt_files` | array | Yes | Array of prompt file paths to materialize (can be empty) |

#### Optional Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `source_repo` | string | URL of source repository |
| `source_commit` | string | Git commit SHA |
| `release_tag` | string | Release tag (often matches `bundle_version`) |

#### Current Bundle Example

The opencode-helper release bundle currently includes 5 presets:

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 1,
  "bundle_name": "opencode-helper",
  "bundle_version": "v1.0.0",
  "presets": [
    {"name": "openai", "description": "OpenAI GPT-5 based coding and docs agents", "entrypoint": "opencode.openai.json", "prompt_files": []},
    {"name": "mixed", "description": "Claude + GPT-5 hybrid coding and docs agents", "entrypoint": "opencode.mixed.json", "prompt_files": []},
    {"name": "big-pickle", "description": "Big-Pickle model based coding and docs agents", "entrypoint": "opencode.big-pickle.json", "prompt_files": []},
    {"name": "minimax", "description": "MiniMax M2.5 based coding and docs agents", "entrypoint": "opencode.minimax.json", "prompt_files": []},
    {"name": "kimi", "description": "Kimi K2.5 based coding and docs agents", "entrypoint": "opencode.kimi.json", "prompt_files": []}
  ]
}
```

#### CLI Validation Rules

The CLI rejects a bundle when:
- `opencode-bundle.manifest.json` is missing from bundle root
- Manifest is not valid JSON
- `manifest_version` is unsupported (not `1`)
- Any required top-level field is missing (`manifest_version`, `bundle_name`, `bundle_version`, `presets`)
- Any preset is missing required fields (`name`, `description`, `entrypoint`, `prompt_files`)
- An `entrypoint` path does not exist in the bundle
- A `prompt_files` entry does not exist in the bundle

#### Generating the Manifest

For the opencode-helper official bundle, the manifest is generated by `scripts/release/build-opencode-helper-bundle.sh`. Third-party bundle creators should include a manually-authored `opencode-bundle.manifest.json` at their bundle root following this contract.

#### <a id="req-f-023"></a>REQ-F-023 - Preset Discovery Across Config Sources

The CLI shall let users list presets across all registered config sources and shall display each preset together with:
- short description
- source identifier
- bundle release/version

Depends on:
- [REQ-F-021](#req-f-021)
- [REQ-F-022](#req-f-022)

#### <a id="req-f-024"></a>REQ-F-024 - Resolve, Install, and Apply a Bundle

Depends on:
- [REQ-F-021](#req-f-021)
- [REQ-F-022](#req-f-022)
- [REQ-F-010](#req-f-010)

#### <a id="req-f-025"></a>REQ-F-025 - Install Referenced Prompt Files

When applying a preset from a config bundle, the CLI shall also materialize any prompt files referenced by that preset into the target project so that the resulting `opencode.json` can resolve `{file:...}` references locally.

Depends on:
- [REQ-F-024](#req-f-024)

#### <a id="req-f-026"></a>REQ-F-026 - Bundle Provenance Reporting

The CLI shall report previously persisted provenance for installed config bundles and for applied presets/prompts, including at least:
- source identifier and source location
- installed bundle release/version
- a source commit identifier when available

Depends on:
- [REQ-F-021](#req-f-021)
- [REQ-F-024](#req-f-024)

#### <a id="req-f-027"></a>REQ-F-027 - Bundle Update Check with User Prompt

For update-capable config sources, the CLI shall detect when a newer compatible bundle release is available for an installed bundle and shall prompt the user before performing a bundle update.

Depends on:
- [REQ-F-021](#req-f-021)
- [REQ-F-024](#req-f-024)
- [REQ-F-026](#req-f-026)

#### <a id="req-f-028"></a>REQ-F-028 - Supported Bundle Source Types

- local directory source
- local `.tar.gz` archive source
- GitHub release bundle source

Depends on:
- [DEC-002](#dec-002)

#### <a id="req-f-029"></a>REQ-F-029 - Bundle Resolution Normalization

The CLI shall resolve every supported config source into a normalized local bundle root before validation and apply.

Normalization requirements:
- exactly one `opencode-bundle.manifest.json` must be discoverable for the resolved bundle
- the CLI shall tolerate bundle content at the source root or nested under a single extracted top-level directory
- after resolution, manifest validation and apply behavior shall be source-type independent

Depends on:
- [REQ-F-022](#req-f-022)
- [REQ-F-024](#req-f-024)
- [REQ-F-028](#req-f-028)

#### <a id="req-f-030"></a>REQ-F-030 - V1 to V2 Upgrade Compatibility and Migration

The CLI shall allow an existing V1 user to upgrade to a V2+-capable CLI via the existing `self-update` flow without breaking an already working project setup.

Upgrade compatibility requirements:
- `self-update` shall continue to upgrade the CLI in place using the existing supported workflow
- existing V1 project setups shall remain usable after upgrading the CLI
- the V2+ CLI shall detect legacy bundled-preset project state when relevant and provide clear guidance for adopting config sources
- if the CLI supports migration from legacy bundled-preset state into config-source-managed state, that migration shall require explicit user action and shall not be forced implicitly during CLI upgrade

Depends on:
- [REQ-F-008](#req-f-008)
- [REQ-F-024](#req-f-024)
- [DEC-002](#dec-002)

#### <a id="req-f-031"></a>REQ-F-031 - Config Source Capability Model

The CLI shall classify each registered config source by capability so source-type-specific behavior is explicit and predictable.

At minimum, the capability model shall distinguish whether a source supports:
- bundle discovery
- version selection
- update checks

Commands that depend on a capability shall surface a clear error when invoked against a source that does not support it.

Depends on:

- [REQ-F-028](#req-f-028)

#### <a id="req-f-032"></a>REQ-F-032 - Remote Bundle Integrity Verification

For remote config sources, the CLI shall verify remote bundle integrity before applying or updating a bundle.

Verification requirements:
- the remote source shall expose integrity metadata sufficient for the CLI to verify the downloaded bundle
- bundle apply or update shall fail closed if integrity metadata is missing, unreadable, or does not match the downloaded bundle
- no downloaded remote bundle contents shall be activated for use if integrity verification fails

Depends on:
- [REQ-F-024](#req-f-024)
- [REQ-F-027](#req-f-027)
- [REQ-F-028](#req-f-028)

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### <a id="req-nf-001"></a>REQ-NF-001 - Minimal Footprint

The CLI should remain small and operationally simple, with minimal runtime dependencies.

#### <a id="req-nf-002"></a>REQ-NF-002 - Offline-Friendly Operation

Normal project setup after CLI installation should not require network access.

Depends on:
- [DEC-001](#dec-001)

#### <a id="req-nf-003"></a>REQ-NF-003 - Deterministic Release Bundle

Each CLI release shall pin a specific compatible set of bundled presets and schemas.

Depends on:
- [DEC-001](#dec-001)

#### <a id="req-nf-004"></a>REQ-NF-004 - Clear Automation Semantics

The CLI should provide stable exit codes and machine-friendly command behavior for validation and diagnostics flows.

#### <a id="req-nf-005"></a>REQ-NF-005 - Cross-Platform Baseline

V1 should support macOS and Linux.

#### <a id="req-nf-006"></a>REQ-NF-006 - Traceable Provenance

Installed assets should be attributable to the CLI release that provided them.

Depends on:
- [REQ-F-009](#req-f-009)

#### <a id="req-nf-007"></a>REQ-NF-007 - Installer Output UX (Theme, Icons, Accessibility)

The installer wizard (`opencode-helper-install`) should provide a pleasant, themed terminal experience that is still accessible and robust across terminals and automation.

Requirements:
- Use a small, consistent set of plain Unicode status icons as line prefixes (e.g. `✓` ok, `!` warning, `x` error, `?` question, `i` info).
- Color is optional, but output shall never rely on color alone; each status line must include a textual label (e.g. `ok:`, `warn:`, `error:`).
- Icons shall be used sparingly (at most one status icon per line, as a prefix).
- Support explicit fallbacks:
  - `--no-color` disables ANSI colors.
  - `--ascii` disables Unicode icons (and uses ASCII-only prefixes such as `[ok]`, `[warn]`, `[err]`, `[?]`, `[i]`).
- When stdout is not a TTY (e.g. piped output / CI logs), color and Unicode icons should be disabled by default.

#### <a id="req-nf-008"></a>REQ-NF-008 - Deterministic Release Packaging

Each published helper release shall produce a deterministic release bundle, release metadata manifest, and checksum manifest from the tagged source tree used for that release.

The release packaging process shall ensure that the bundled helper executable, presets, schemas, and provenance metadata all correspond to the same tagged release.

Depends on:
- [REQ-NF-003](#req-nf-003)
- [REQ-F-015](#req-f-015)
- [REQ-F-016](#req-f-016)

#### <a id="req-nf-009"></a>REQ-NF-009 - Auditable Installed Provenance

The installed helper should expose enough local provenance metadata to identify the active release tag, source commit, and bundled asset set without requiring access to the source repository.

Depends on:
- [REQ-F-018](#req-f-018)
- [REQ-NF-006](#req-nf-006)

## User Story Backlog Placeholder

User stories will be added later and must:
- have stable IDs using the format `US-###`
- reference at least one feature ID
- reference at least one requirement ID
- include acceptance criteria
- identify whether the story is user-facing, maintainer-facing, or release-engineering-facing

Traceability workflow:
- Every implementation PR must declare exactly one primary user story.
- Primary story selection rules (in order):
  - If the user request names a `US-###`, that is the primary story.
  - Otherwise, choose the one story whose acceptance criteria the PR is intended to complete end-to-end.
  - If the change spans multiple stories and none is clearly primary, split into multiple PRs (recommended) or explicitly pick a primary and list the rest as secondary (see below).
- PR title format (primary story only): `US-###: <short title>`
- PR body must contain a primary line: `Implements: US-###`
- If the PR also advances other stories, include additional lines:
  - `Also advances: US-###, US-###` (optional)
  - Do not mark secondary stories `Done` unless their acceptance criteria are fully satisfied by this PR.
- Updating story entries in this document:
  - Primary story: update the story entry with the PR reference.
    - If all acceptance criteria are satisfied, set `Status: Done`.
    - If not all acceptance criteria are satisfied, set `Status: In progress` or `Status: In review` (choose the closest), and keep it out of `Done`.
  - Secondary stories (if listed): only add the PR reference if the PR is intentionally tracked there; never set `Status: Done` unless fully complete.
- PR reference format:
  - Preferred: `PR: [#<number>](<url>)`
  - Acceptable: `PR: #<number>`
- Practical: if the PR number/URL is not known yet, open the PR with `PR: TBD`, then update the same PR branch before merge to replace `TBD` with the actual PR reference.

### User Stories (Iteration 1)

Note:
- `US-001` through `US-011` were completed before the current one-primary-story-per-PR traceability rule was adopted, so several of those stories share legacy implementation PR references.

### <a id="us-012"></a>US-012 - Install wizard performs global install and updates PATH

Type:

Related requirements:
- [REQ-F-012](#req-f-012)
- [REQ-F-014](#req-f-014)

Story:
- As a developer, I want an interactive install wizard (`opencode-helper-install`) that installs `opencode-helper` globally and updates my shell config so that I can run `opencode-helper` from a new terminal without manual PATH steps.

Acceptance criteria:
- Given `opencode-helper-install` installs into an unprivileged `--bin-dir` (e.g. `~/.local/bin`), when the wizard completes, then opening a new terminal session allows running `opencode-helper` successfully without manual `PATH` steps.
- Given the user selects a privileged `--bin-dir` (e.g. `/usr/local/bin`), when the install step writes the binary, then the flow requests `sudo`; and when the flow edits shell config, then it does not use `sudo`.
- Given the wizard has been run once, when it is re-run with the same `--bin-dir`, then the shell config contains exactly one managed marker block and the resulting `PATH` update includes the `--bin-dir` exactly once.
- The shell config file modified contains the exact sentinel lines `# opencode-helper: BEGIN managed PATH` and `# opencode-helper: END managed PATH`.

Related requirements:

Story:
- As a developer, I want `opencode-helper-install` to detect my shell and update the correct shell config when possible so that PATH setup is reliable while non-interactive installs still complete.

Acceptance criteria:
- Given the active shell is zsh, when the wizard updates `PATH`, then it writes to `~/.zshrc`.
- Given the active shell is bash on macOS, when the wizard updates `PATH`, then it writes to the first match in order: `~/.bash_profile` (if exists), else `~/.bashrc` (if exists), else creates and writes `~/.bash_profile`.
- Given the active shell is bash on Linux, when the wizard updates `PATH`, then it writes to the first match in order: `~/.bashrc` (if exists), else `~/.bash_profile` (if exists), else creates and writes `~/.bashrc`.
- Given the active shell is fish, when the wizard updates `PATH`, then it writes to `~/.config/fish/config.fish`.
- Given `SHELL` is set to a supported shell, when running `opencode-helper-install --yes --bin-dir <path>`, then the install completes without prompts and updates the shell config derived from `SHELL`.
- Given `SHELL` is unset (or unsupported), when running `opencode-helper-install --yes --bin-dir <path>`, then the install succeeds, skips shell config edits, and prints manual PATH instructions.

Acceptance criteria:
- Given an existing helper installation at a known `--bin-dir` location, when I run `opencode-helper self-update`, then the updated helper is installed to the same `--bin-dir` location without requiring re-configuration.
- Given an existing helper installation with a stable symlink or launcher, when `self-update` installs a newer release, then the stable launcher/symlink is updated to point to the newly installed release.
- Given an existing helper installation, when `self-update` completes successfully, then previously installed releases remain on disk and are available for rollback via `opencode-helper release use <tag>`.
- Given `opencode-helper self-update --version <tag>`, when `<tag>` exists as an installable GitHub release, then self-update installs that specific version to the existing `--bin-dir` location.
- Given `opencode-helper self-update`, when a newer release is available, then the CLI downloads, verifies, and activates the newer release; when no newer release is available, then the CLI reports that the current release is up-to-date and exits 0.
- Given `opencode-helper self-update`, when network access is unavailable or the release fetch fails, then the CLI exits non-zero with a clear error message and the previous installation remains intact.

- [REQ-F-010](#req-f-010)

Story:
- As a developer, I want to select and apply a preset interactively from a numbered list so that I can switch configurations without remembering preset names.

Rationale:
Currently, switching presets requires two steps: `preset list` (to see names) then `preset use <name>` (to apply). This adds friction.

Acceptance criteria:
- Given `opencode-helper preset switch` is invoked in a TTY, when the command runs, then it displays a numbered list of all available presets with their descriptions and indicates the currently selected preset (if a valid manifest exists).
- Given `opencode-helper preset switch` is invoked with piped stdin, when the input is a number (1-5), then the preset at that position is applied.
- Given `opencode-helper preset switch` is invoked with piped stdin, when the input is a preset name or partial match, then the matching preset is applied.
- Given an invalid selection, when in TTY mode, then the command shows an error and re-prompts for input.
- Given an invalid selection, when in non-TTY mode, then the command exits non-zero with a clear error.
- Given `opencode-helper preset switch`, when the selected preset is already applied and no overwrite is desired, then overwrite is blocked without `--force`.
- Given `opencode-helper preset switch --dry-run`, then the command shows what would happen without writing any files.
- Given `opencode-helper preset switch --force`, then the command overwrites the existing preset.
- Given `opencode-helper preset switch --project-root <path>`, when a valid manifest exists, then the current preset is indicated in the interactive list.
- Given `opencode-helper preset switch --project-root <path>`, when no manifest is found, then the command warns the user but proceeds to display the preset list without a current indicator.

Rationale:
The manifest already stores `preset_name`, but there is no command to read it. Users lack context when running validation or other commands.

Acceptance criteria:
- Given a project with a valid manifest, when `opencode-helper preset current` runs, then it outputs the preset name, description, source file, and the helper version that applied it.
- Given a project with a missing manifest, when `opencode-helper preset current` runs, then it exits with a stable missing exit code and prints an actionable message.
- Given a project with a drifted or invalid manifest, when `opencode-helper preset current` runs, then it exits with a stable drift exit code and prints diagnostics.
- Given `opencode-helper preset current --project-root <path>`, then it reads the manifest from the specified project root.

- Given a source cannot be validated or its bundle manifest is missing/invalid, when I run `opencode-helper source add <location>`, then the command exits non-zero with a clear validation error and does not add the source.
- Given one or more sources exist, when I run `opencode-helper source remove <source-id>`, then that source is removed from the registry and no longer appears in `source list`.

- Given a source resolves to a bundle with a missing or invalid manifest, when the CLI inspects that source, then it excludes that bundle from preset discovery and reports an actionable validation error.
- Given no config sources are registered, when I run `opencode-helper preset list --sources`, then the command exits with the documented status and prints actionable guidance to add a source.

Acceptance criteria:
- Given a registered source and a resolvable bundle selector, when I run `opencode-helper bundle apply <source-id> [--version <tag>] --preset <name> --project-root <path>`, then the CLI resolves/caches the bundle (if needed), uses the manifest-declared `entrypoint`, materializes the preset into the target project, and persists bundle provenance needed for later status/update behavior.
- Given the target project contains existing files that would be overwritten, when I run the command without `--force`, then the command exits non-zero and makes no destructive changes.
- Given the command is run with `--dry-run`, when it completes, then it prints the planned changes and writes no files.

- Given a referenced prompt file already exists in the project, when applying without `--force`, then the command exits non-zero and does not overwrite the existing prompt file.

- Given I decline the prompt, when the command exits, then no changes are made and the currently installed bundle remains active.
- Given the selected source does not support update checks, when I run the update command, then the CLI exits non-zero with a clear capability error and leaves existing installed bundles unchanged.
- Given integrity verification for the downloaded remote bundle fails, when I run the update command, then the CLI exits non-zero and does not activate the downloaded bundle.

- Given integrity metadata is missing, unreadable, or does not match the downloaded bundle, when verification runs, then the CLI exits non-zero and does not activate the downloaded bundle.
- Given verification succeeds, when the remote bundle is applied or updated, then the verified bundle is the one resolved into the normalized local bundle root.

## Open Questions for Post-V1

- Should the CLI support exporting presets under names other than `opencode.json`?
- Should schema install support both project-local and user-global scopes in V1, or should V1 stay project-local only?
- Should `self-update` support pinned release channels or version constraints?
- Should the CLI embed asset checksums and manifest metadata directly for stronger provenance reporting?
- Should custom user overlays on top of official presets be supported in V2?
